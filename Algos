Algorithms (Algos) are a set of instructions that are introduced to carry out a specific task. Algorithms are introduced to automate trading to generate profits at a frequency impossible to a human trader. The process is referred to as algorithmic trading, and it sets rules based on pricing, quantity, timing, and other mathematical models. Other variations of algorithmic trading include automated trading and black-box trading.

Algorithmic trading rules out the human (emotional) impact on trading activities. The use of sophisticated algorithms is common among institutional investors like investment banks, pension funds and hedge funds due to the large volumes of shares that they trade daily. This allows them to get the best possible price at minimal costs and without significantly affecting the stock price.
